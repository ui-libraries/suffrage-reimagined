            The period from
            <b class="embolden">1870 to 1890</b> was one of both excitement and disappointment for Iowa suffragists.
            When
            Iowa’s constitution was adopted in
            <b class="embolden">1857</b>, the word “white” was included in the voting section, but
            in
            <b
              class="embolden"
            >1868</b>, Iowans voted to remove it, enfranchising black and Native American men in law, if not
            always in
            practice.
          </div>

          <div>
            This dramatic change in just over a decade led women to believe they would be next. Indeed, in
            <b
              class="embolden"
            >1870</b>,
            the Iowa Legislature hired a female clerk (Mary Spencer), changed the code so women could practice law,
            and approved a resolution to amend the constitution and allow women to vote.

          <div>
            Quaker and peace activist Joseph Dugdale spearheaded a women’s rights convention in Mount Pleasant in
            <b
              class="embolden"
            >1870</b>, which led to the organization of the Iowa Woman Suffrage Association (later known as the
            Iowa
            Equal Suffrage Association). A Mount Pleasant Journal editorial encouraged other states to look to Iowa
            as an example of progress.
          </div>

          <div>
            In
            <b class="embolden">1871</b>, a free love scandal rocked the nation and splintered the suffrage movement in Iowa. The
            <b
              class="embolden"
            >1872</b>
            General Assembly rejected the women’s suffrage resolution - forcing the women to start over in the
            legislature.
          </div>

          <div>
            Meanwhile, more and more Iowa women began speaking publicly and getting involved in local, state, and
            national suffrage organizations.
