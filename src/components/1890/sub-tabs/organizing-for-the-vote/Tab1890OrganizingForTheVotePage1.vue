        Women’s clubs exploded into existence in the latter half of the nineteenth century and were extremely
        important to the suffrage movement.
      </div>
      <div>
        Some, such as the Charles City Political Equality Club, were devoted almost solely to getting the vote.
        Others, such as the Proteus Club of Des Moines and the Cary Club of Marion, were focused on intellectual
        and community improvement. These clubs provided an established network of active women ripe for
        conversion to the suffrage cause.

      <div>
        In
        <b class="embolden">1907</b>, IESA officers lived in cities and towns across the state, including Chariton, Des Moines,
        Hull, Ida Grove, Mason City, Maquoketa, Ottumwa, Panora, Sheldon, Shenandoah, and Sioux City. Map

        In July
        <b class="embolden">1912</b>, Iowa suffragists staged an automobile tour from Des Moines to Highland Park, Valley
        Junction, and Mitchellville. They would arrive at a stop, play cornets to announce their arrival and
        then give speeches.
      </div>
      <div>
        Another automobile tour was launched in September
        <b class="embolden">1913</b>
, going from central Iowa to the eastern border.
        An estimated 7,500 people in 30 towns saw the mobile caravan.

      <div>
        In
        <b class="embolden">1909</b>, her husband, Iowa Senator George Cosson, supported a bill to give women the vote. The bill was
        quickly killed.

        This
        <b class="embolden">1897</b> sheet music dedicated to the Political Equality Club of Emmetsburg, Iowa details, in song, why
        Iowa women should vote.

        Composer Lilla Cordelia Ormsby Bliven moved to Palo Alto County, Iowa from Michigan in the
        <b class="embolden">1880s</b> with
        her husband, Charles Bliven. Lilla Bliven wrote verses and songs for almost every occasion, according to
        her son Bruce Bliven’s reminiscences in the August

            In
            <b class="embolden">1913</b>, the Proteus Club of Des Moines put on a fundraising event. Their play, “The Militant
            Husbandette,” spoofed Molière's work by parodying activities of militant British suffragettes.
          </div>
          <div>
            The Iowa Federation of Women’s Clubs (IFWC) organized in
            <b class="embolden">1893</b> and provided organizational support and
            ideas for hundreds of clubs by the
            <b class="embolden">1920s</b>. During this time period, middle-class women had both increased
            leisure time and increased education resulting in a proliferation of women’s clubs focused on just about
            everything including education, conservation, philanthropy, civic duties, social causes and intellectual
            improvement.
          </div>
          <div>
            In
            <b class="embolden">1911</b>, the IFWC became one of the first state federations to endorse suffrage.

          <div>
            Carrie Dean graduated from Tipton, Iowa high school in
            <b class="embolden">1895</b> and moved to Ida Grove, Iowa after her
            marriage in the early
            <b class="embolden">1900s</b>. Once there, she joined the Ida Grove Civic Club, which she remembered in
            her
            <b class="embolden">1936</b> reminiscences as a suffrage club that disguised its name to appeal to conservative
            sensibilities.
          </div>
          <div>
            In addition to suffrage activities, the club also worked to get a new library, high school, golf course
            and swimming pool in Ida Grove.

            Sixteen years after Iowa women began voting, Carrie Pruyn recalled touring the rural areas around Ida
            Grove in her Buick, which she had decorated with suffrage slogans, and arguing with farmers who wanted
            the women to go back home and take care of the babies.

        Although rural males made up 70 percent of Iowa’s voting population, it was not until the
        <b class="embolden">1910s</b> that
        the Iowa Equal Suffrage Association began focusing on educating rural voters.

      <div>
        Beginning in the early 1900s, African American Iowans worked for suffrage mainly through women’s clubs. Founded in 1902,
        the Iowa Association of Colored Women’s Clubs (IACWC - later known as the Iowa Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs)
        provided an umbrella organization for the activism of clubwomen.
      </div>
      <div>
        By the 1910s, suffrage clubs in IACWC included the Suffragette Club of Des Moines and various Mary Church Terrell clubs.
        The IACWC established a standing suffrage committee in 1914 headed by Teresa Adams of Davenport.
        In 1916, African American women in Buxton, Iowa marched for suffrage in a family parade.
      </div>
      <div>
        Organizations such as IACWC focused on many inequalities facing African American women in areas such as education,
        working wages and property rights.

      <div>
        Officers of the Des Moines Suffrage Club, an African American women’s club, wrote this sympathy note (above)
        to Fannie Wilson on the death of her husband. African American obituaries saved by Wilson's daughter,
        Gwendolyn Wilson Fowler, show that African American women in the 1900s were involved in suffrage clubs
        and, later, the League of Women Voters.
