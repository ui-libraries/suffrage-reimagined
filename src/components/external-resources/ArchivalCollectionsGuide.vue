        </template>
        <p>Finding information in archival collections related to women’s suffrage in Iowa can be compared to a treasure
          hunt.</p>
        <p>Some collections, such as the Iowa Suffrage Memorial Commission and Woman’s Christian Temperance Union
          records,
          are obvious starting points because both organizations were known to be heavily involved in the suffrage
          movement.
        </p>
        <p>Others, such as the papers of Ellen Mowrer Miller (a nineteenth century pioneer woman), contain brief nuggets
          of
          suffrage information in diaries and letters. The <a href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/suffrage"
            target="_blank">Women’s Suffrage in Iowa Digital Collection</a> strives to bring users a taste of the
          variety of
          information about women’s suffrage that has been preserved in the Iowa Women’s Archives and other institutions
          across the state.</p>
        <p>This guide gives a brief explanation of each collection used to create the digital collection and gives
          researchers an idea of what else is available in the archival collections.</p>
        <p>In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, publishing standards like page numbers were not very standardized.
          Making these resources readable for a twenty-first century computer database and accessible for generations of
          future users can be a challenge. Therefore, digitization decisions made by IWA staff have been included in the
          collection descriptions. One hint for researchers is to make sure to look at the digital image for page
          numbers
          when preparing a citation. The page numbers in the navigation menu are for the computer and may not reflect
          the
          actual page number of the physical object.</p>

        <p>Margaret Atherton Bonney was a historian and editor at the State Historical Society of Iowa in Iowa City. One
          of
          the people she researched was Mary Jane Whitely Coggeshall (1836-1911), known as “The Mother of Woman Suffrage
          in
          Iowa.” Included in Bonney’s research files are an <a href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,1203"
            target="_blank">undated photograph</a> of Mary Jane Coggeshall and several brochures from Coggeshall’s
          posthumous induction into the Iowa Women’s Hall of Fame in 1990. Photocopies Bonney made of primary source
          documents from other repositories are not included in the digital collection, but are available to researchers
          at
          IWA. She did much of her research on Coggeshall using the <a
            href="http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/suffrage/suffrage/CollectionRegister.pdf?func=direct&amp;doc_number=003490481&amp;local_base=iow06"

            target="_blank">Lucille Ketchum Carter papers</a>. <em>1936-2003. 1 linear foot</em>.</p>
        <p>Lucille Ketchum Carter grew up in Missouri and graduated from nursing school at the State University of Iowa
          (now
          the University of Iowa). Later she actively campaigned for her husband, Iowa Congressman Steven V. Carter. In
          <a href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,1110" target="_blank">undated writings</a>, she describes
          the
          first time her mother, Matilda Jane Ketchum, voted and how that experience influenced her own civic activities
          throughout her life.</p>

            target="_blank">Cary Club of Marion, Iowa records</a>. <em>1883-1980. 1.5 linear feet.</em></p>
        <p>The Cary Club of Marion, Iowa was founded in 1878 to give women an outlet for intellectual improvement.
          Discussions and programs were held twice a month on a variety of topics including book reviews, historical
          subjects and current events such as suffrage. The <a href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,1149"
            target="_blank">minutes</a> and <a href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,1200"
            target="_blank">programs</a> included in the digital collection contain brief mentions of suffrage and women
          in
          politics in the 1900s, but also provide insight into how women’s clubs at all levels were discussing the
          issues of
          the day and organizing around common causes. The October 5, 1915 entry about the status of women includes an
          editorial comment from the secretary, which is a rare occurrence in club minutes from this time period.</p>

            target="_blank">Jennifer Riggs Cosson papers</a>. <em>1890-1943. 10 linear inches.</em></p>
        <p>Jennifer Riggs Cosson attended Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa and graduated in 1899 with a bachelor’s
          degree
          in education. While she was there, she wrote a speech entitled <a
            href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,1786" target="_blank">“The American Girl of Today,”</a> in
          which
          she argued that women should not agitate for reform because it would come in its own time. In other speeches,
          she
          urged women should be determined in their pursuit of the ballot, but she never agreed with militant actions
          such
          as parades or demonstrations (<a href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,1786" target="_blank">“Why
            Women
            Should Ask for the Ballot”</a>, undated). </p>
        <p>Jennifer Cosson became active in civic affairs, serving on the Des Moines Parks Board, the Simpson College
          Board,
          the Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA) committee, P.E.O., and the Ladies Legislative League. </p>
        <p>In 1909, her husband, George Cosson, was elected to the Iowa Senate, and from 1911 to 1917 he held the office
          of
          Attorney General of the State of Iowa. In 1909, George Cosson is mentioned in the Woman’s Christian Temperance
          Union of Iowa <em>Proceedings</em> as supporting suffrage legislation. The bill he supported, however, quickly
          died. His papers are located in the <a href="http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/spec-coll/" target="_blank">University
            of
            Iowa Special Collections Department</a>.</p>

            target="_blank">Gwendolyn Wilson Fowler</a>. <em>1905-1996. 5.50 linear feet.</em></p>
        <p>Gwendolyn Fowler (1907 - 1997) was the first African American woman to obtain a pharmaceutical degree and to
          be
          officially registered as a pharmacist in the state of Iowa. She was a program analyst for the United State
          Foreign
          Service in Vietnam in the 1950s before returning to Des Moines and working as a pharmacist at Broadlawns
          Hospital.
        </p>
        <p>Fowler was a lifetime member of both the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)
          and
          the African Methodist Episcopal Church. She was also a member of the Des Moines Women’s Club and in 1987 was
          inducted into the Iowa Women’s Hall of Fame. The digital collection contains a <a
            href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,2837" target="_blank">sympathy note</a> for Fowler’s mother,
          Fannie Robinson Wilson, from the Des Moines Suffrage Club, but includes no more documentation specifically
          pertaining to suffrage. Various obituaries of Fowler’s friends and family members provide insight into the
          lives
          of African Americans in Iowa during this time, including membership in suffrage clubs such as the Mary Church
          Terrell Club.</p>

            target="_blank">Mary Ankeny Hunter papers</a>. <em>1940. 1 item.</em></p>
        <p>Mary Ankeny Hunter was involved in the Polk County Woman Suffrage Society (later the Des Moines Political
          Equality Club), the League of Women Voters of Iowa, the Votes for Women League and the Polk County League of
          Women
          Voters. Beginning in 1922, she served as secretary of the Iowa Suffrage Memorial Commission, eventually
          holding
          the vice presidential and presidential offices. She was president when the memorial at the Iowa State Capitol
          was
          completed in 1936. This <a href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,2720"
            target="_blank">autobiographical

        <p>Organized in 1893, by the 1920s, the Iowa Federation of Women’s Clubs (IFWC) had 810 clubs with over 40,000
          members. The IFWC’s goal was to connect clubwomen across the state through publications and conferences.
          Several
          Iowa clubs were in favor of suffrage and the <a href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,1937"
            target="_blank">proceedings</a> of the IFWC reflect that. This collection also has information on the 1919
          bill
          that granted presidential suffrage to Iowa women. The club’s records in IWA also document the literary and
          civic
          pursuits of clubs across the state.</p>

        <p>Since the Iowa Suffrage Memorial Commission (ISMC) was an organization dedicated solely to recognizing the
          contributions Iowa women made to the suffrage campaign, this collection has been digitized in its entirety.
        </p>
        <p>The bulk of the collection consists of pamphlets and correspondence. The pamphlets are mainly pro-suffrage
          propaganda printed by the <a href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,1315" target="_blank">Iowa Equal
            Suffrage Association (IESA)</a> and the <a href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,1710"
            target="_blank">National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA)</a>. Most of the <a
            href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,1398" target="_blank">correspondence</a> consists of letters
          between Carrie Chapman Catt, president of NAWSA and honorary president of the commission, and Mary Ankeny
          Hunter,
          president of the commission. Additional resources of the ISMC can be found in the <a

        <p>The League of Women Voters (LWV) of Iowa was founded in 1920 as the Iowa Equal Suffrage Association (IESA)
          disbanded. Women organized to educate other women about their new political responsibilities. The LWV
          histories
          include recollections from journalist Dorothy Ashby Pownall and activist Pauline Devitt. Reports of state
          organizers reveal how difficult it was to travel and host events in the 1920s. A League <a
            href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,246" target="_blank">scrapbook</a> contains photographs of
          many
          prominent IESA figures and essays about the history of women’s organizations in Iowa.</p>
        <p>The LWV record books are extensive; only the <a href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,1975"
            target="_blank">early years</a> of the first book have been digitized.
          IWA and other state archival institutions have extensive records from local LWV chapters. See the

        </p>
        <p>The League of Women Voters of Johnson County was organized in 1920. Its <a
            href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,309" target="_blank">1922 <em>Bulletin</em></a> includes a
          good
          description of the League’s early aims. Since few bulletins from the early years of the League have survived,
          this
          is a rare glimpse into activities of the early 1920s.</p>
        <p>The <a href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,300" target="_blank">Financial Accounts ledger from
            1920-1946 </a>includes notations interspersed between blank pages. The dozens of pages not digitized were
          completely blank. Researchers can see an example of those blank pages on Page 18 &amp; 19 in the digital
          collection. Any page with writing was digitized.</p>

        <p>The Marion Federation of Women’s Clubs was an umbrella organization that met monthly at the Marion Public
          Library, allowing individual women’s clubs to work together on community service projects. Suffrage was
          mentioned
          several times in the <a href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,376" target="_blank">minutes</a> from
          1913-1917 and club members debated and eventually voted to found a Cedar County Suffrage League.
          Unfortunately,
          the records of this county league appear to have been lost.</p>

            target="_blank">Ellen Mowrer Miller papers</a>. <em>1856-1994. 10 linear inches.</em></p>
        <p>Miller’s papers are an excellent example of how topical information can be “hidden” in archival collections.
          Ellen Mowrer Miller grew up in Boone County, Iowa after her family moved from Pennsylvania, and was not
          actively
          involved in the suffrage movement. However, she lived and wrote during the late nineteenth and early twentieth
          centuries when suffrage was a prominent topic in the news and she included at least one mention of suffrage in
          her
          <a href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,348" target="_blank">diary</a>. A <a
            href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,325" target="_blank">letter</a> from her brother Milton
          Mowrer, a
          medical student in Philadelphia from 1866 to 1868, mentions a lecture by Henry Ward Beecher on Universal
          Suffrage.
          Milton Mowrer took his date to see Beecher speak for 75 cents. These brief references show that suffrage was
          being
          discussed by ordinary people across the country and not just by those actively involved in the movement. </p>

            target="_blank">Louise Rosenfield Noun papers</a>. <em>1926-2002. 13 linear feet.</em></p>
        <p>Louise Rosenfield Noun was an Iowa historian, women’s rights activist and art collector. Her book <a
            href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,2308" target="_blank"><em> Strong-Minded Women: The Emergence
              of
              the Woman-Suffrage Movement in Iowa</em></a> (ISU Press, 1969) is considered the seminal work on women’s
          suffrage in Iowa. All subsequent research on suffrage in Iowa relied heavily on Noun. This work, and her book
          <a href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,2524" target="_blank"><em>Leader and Pariah: Annie Savery
              and the

          Press, 1990), are included in their entireties in the digital collection. In her memoir, Noun describes her
          mother’s suffrage work, her own changing ideas about feminism, and surprises she encountered when researching
          the
          suffrage movement in Iowa. She also wrote numerous articles on suffrage and on figures such as Carrie Chapman
          Catt
          and Flora Dunlap. The drafts of these articles are available to researchers at the <a
            href="http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/iwa/" target="_blank">Iowa Women’s Archives</a>. (The research files for

        <p>Elvira Gaston Platt, teacher and abolitionist, was born in New York in 1818 and moved west after her marriage
          in
          1841. In 1847 she and her husband moved to Fremont County, Iowa, turned to farming, and began assisting
          fugitive
          slaves on the underground railroad. During these years, Platt corresponded with her husband’s sisters,
          including
          Mrs. Mary A. Platt Darwin. Darwin was one of Iowa’s leading female lecturers in the 1860s and was present at
          the
          first women’s suffrage convention in Mt. Pleasant. A handful of the <a
            href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,1120" target="_blank">letters</a> address suffrage and

        <p>Journalist Dorothy Ashby was hired as a feature writer for the <em>Des Moines Capital</em> in 1917 and worked
          there until 1920. She was the only “girl reporter” to cover Camp Dodge in Des Moines during World War I, but
          she
          also wrote <a href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,320" target="_blank">feature articles</a> on
          prominent Iowa women, including a handful on suffrage and women’s political activities. In 1955, Pownall gave
          a <a href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,42" target="_blank">speech</a> to the League of Women
          Voters
          remembering her coverage of the last convention of the Iowa Equal Suffrage Association and how “dull” the
          suffragists could be. </p>

          graduated

        <p>The Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) of Iowa was supportive of the suffrage movement from its fourth

          reveal the changing strategies used by suffragists and temperance workers. These books include detailed
          descriptions of activities, including financial information, and exhortations to support suffrage. These
          passages
          provide a rare glimpse behind the scenes of a powerful women’s organization. Personal opinions of individual
          women
          are printed in the club proceedings, which is unusual for records of that time. Since these proceedings are so
          extensive, only the sections pertinent to suffrage in Iowa have been digitized. Among other topics covered in
          convention proceedings (available in physical form at the Iowa Women’s Archives) are temperance, foreign

            <p></p>
            <p>This is <em>the</em> flagship work on women’s suffrage in Iowa. Noun spent countless hours tracking down
              primary sources scattered all over the country to document the nineteenth century movement in the Hawkeye
              state. Subsequent works on women’s suffrage in Iowa and the national movement rely heavily on this book.
              Her

            <p></p>
            <p>This book highlights a forgotten leader of the women’s suffrage movement in Iowa: Annie Savery. Savery
              was a
              correspondent of Amelia Bloomer and one of the first women in Iowa to speak publicly about women’s rights.
              Later histories glossed over or edited out Savery’s contributions partly because she defended the right of
              free-love advocates to have their own opinions and spoke out against the conservative swing of Iowa
              suffrage
              societies in the early 1870s. The primary documents printed at the end of the book provide insight into
              the

        <p>The Charles City Political Equality Club was established in November 1891 by Carrie Lane Chapman with
          fourteen
          charter members. The club’s constitution states that its purpose was to promote interest in “principles of
          impartial suffrage and ... secure such state and national legislation as shall be necessary to establish the
          same.” Members of the Political Equality Club were invited to read a suffrage paper to the WCTU. Other topics
          of
          discussion included women as poets and women as inventors. This collection includes <a
            href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,2922" target="_blank">two secretary’s books</a> containing
          the

          from
          the club’s first meeting on November 7, 1891 through March 10, 1897. There is also a black and white
          photograph
          taken in 1938 of Anna Mahara (the club’s first secretary) standing with Ivadelle Lane (Carrie Chapman Catt’s
          grandniece) in front of a marker at the girlhood home of Carrie Chapman Catt.</p>

          while
          Lawther served on IESA, was also a frequent correspondent. The collection also includes material on temperance

        <p>The State University of Iowa (S.U.I.) Equal Suffrage Association was established in 1916 on the campus of the
          State University of Iowa (now the University of Iowa) to promote the cause of equal suffrage in the months
          prior
          to the June 1916 suffrage referendum. After the amendment was defeated, the organization resolved to “continue
          its
          existence until equal suffrage is granted to all citizens of the state of Iowa.” Included are <a
            href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,3394" target="_blank">minutes</a> of four meetings with a
          list of
          the names of 224 members. A number of significant University figures belonged to this club, including Ruth
          Gallaher and Bertha Shambaugh.</p>
