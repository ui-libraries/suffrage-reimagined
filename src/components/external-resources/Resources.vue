            <p>This bipartisan initiative is seeking to achieve political equality in Iowa’s Legislature, Congressional
              delegation, and the governor’s office by 2020, the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage. Although Iowa
              women
              make up 53 percent of the population, only 22.6 percent of elected officials are female. This effort seeks
              to
              educate and support female candidates for office between 2010 and 2020.</p>

                <p>Iowa-raised Jay N. (Ding) Darling won two Pulitzer Prizes for his editorial cartoons, which he drew
                  almost
                  daily between 1900 and 1949. Special Collections has digitized more than 6,000 original images
                  available in
                  an online collection. A search for women’s suffrage produces 44 cartoons-many of which are specific to
                  Iowa,
                  especially Sioux City. These give insight into stereotypes and caricatures of suffragists.</p>

                <p></p>


                <p>This digital collection presents promotional circulars (publicity brochures), musical and spoken word
                  recordings, and programs drawn from the Records of the Redpath Lyceum Bureau, the largest booking
                  agency for
                  circuit Chautauqua. Between 1904 and 1932, the enterprise brought together thousands of performers and
                  lecturers and millions of small town residents under large canvas tents. Take special note of
                  lecturers Mrs.
                  J. Redding Cole, Charles Zueblin, Belle Kearney, Jeannette Rankin, Charles Howard Plattenburg, Grace
                  Wilbur
                  Trout, S.A. Baldus, C.B. Rayhill, and Mecca Marie Varney for references to the suffrage movement, as
                  these
                  individuals each made a circuit stop in Iowa. Lecture titles include “Women Who Toil,” “Woman and the
                  Ballot,” “The Fallacy of Woman’s Suffrage,” and “The Citizen Mother.” </p>

                  cases.</strong>
                <p></p>

                <p>Bushnell Hamlin founded <em>The Trident</em> newsletter in 1904 to cover news, society and women’s
                  issues
                  in the Tri City Area, which included Davenport, Moline and Rock Island.</p>
                <p> Bushnell Hamlin was a suffragist and her publications often covered national and international
                  suffrage
                  news. She advocated for women’s involvement in clubs, and <em>The Trident</em> is full of clubwomen
                  news.
                  She refused to pay a license tax in 1909 and urged the mayor to throw her in jail. In 1910, she
                  campaigned
                  for the position of Davenport school director, and <em> The Trident </em>ceased publication. Although
                  a
                  fascinating source of society and business life, the newsletters provide little local information on
                  suffrage. They have been scanned and will eventually be placed in the <a href="http://ir.uiowa.edu/"

                <p>UI Special Collections has records from many literary and debate societies and university clubs. Some
                  are
                  specifically related to women, others are men’s clubs. In the 1890s and early 1900s many of the men’s
                  clubs
                  at the university had female counterparts with which they would socialize and plan events.
                  Two men’s groups whose records briefly record women’s suffrage debates are Zetagathian and
                  Philomathean.
                  Most of the women’s club records make no mention of suffrage or women’s rights.</p>

                <p>The First Unitarian Universalist Church of Des Moines had many ministers, including women, who were
                  active
                  in the suffrage movement. The church and Rev. Eleanor E. Gordon pushed for a suffrage parade, which
                  occurred
                  in Boone, Iowa in 1908. The women’s Unity Circle, founded in 1879, is believed to be the oldest
                  continuously
                  operating women’s group in Des Moines. The collection contains files on ministers, minutes, financial
                  records, histories, and scrapbooks.</p>

            <p>The Iowa Commission on the Status of Women is the state agency that serves in a direct advocacy role for
              women
              and girls. Each year, through a public input process, the Commission develops a policy agenda aimed at
              providing
              optimal results for women through changes in the law or other changes in the actions or policies of state
              government. ICSW engages in direct advocacy and works with a variety of partners to support grassroots
              advocacy
              on women’s issues.</p>
            <p>The ICSW encourages equal participation of women and men in politics to more accurately reflect the
              composition
              of society. The following pdf discusses this initiative and highlights trends in female political

                <p>After women won the right to vote, there were several efforts to educate new voters about the
                  political
                  process and political issues. The Ames Business and Professional Women’s records contain information

                <p>In 1866, Mary Newbury Adams became interested in women’s suffrage and did much to promote it through
                  writing and speaking, and as an organizer of state, regional, and national meetings. She was a
                  founding
                  member of the Northern Iowa Woman Suffrage Association, the first suffrage organization in Iowa. She
                  was

                  Welch, and the organizer and head of the Department of Domestic Economy at Iowa State University. The

                  Suffrage Cookbook,” was compiled by Mrs. L.O. Kleber in 1915 and was owned by suffragist Carrie
                  Chapman
                  Catt. One of the recipes was “Pie for a Suffragist’s Doubting Husband.”</p>

        <p>Local newspapers covered the suffrage movement from its inception until women won the right to vote. In the
          late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, conversations about social and political issues were often
          carried out through the pages of the editorial sections. In addition, many newspapers either defended or
          vilified suffragists--and sometimes switched sides. Public libraries are often a good source for Iowa
          newspapers. They may have physical, microfilm or online copies.</p>

              Change.</em> Des Moines, Iowa: League of Women Voters of Iowa, 1996.</strong></p>
        <p>Created as a way to celebrate the League of Women Voters of Iowa’s 75th anniversary in 1995, this booklet
          includes documentation of League members’ own stories about their involvement in League activities, studies,
          and action programs. Brief accounts of its founding and highlights of events throughout its history showcase
          the impact that the League of Women Voters had on individuals, their community, and local and state
          governments.</p>

        <p><strong>Bloomer, Amelia. <em>Iowa</em>. Vol. 3, chap. XLV in <em>History of Woman Suffrage 1876-1885</em>,
            ed. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony and Matilda Joslyn Gage, 612-637. Rochester, New York:
            Charles Mann Printing Co., 1886</strong></p>
        <p>Part of a massive history of women’s suffrage compiled by the leaders of the National American Woman
          Suffrage Association, the Iowa chapter portrays the state as a land of honeysuckle and wild roses with
          “moral, virtuous, and intelligent people.”</p>
        <p> Written by well-known suffragist Amelia Bloomer, this chapter was heavily edited by Elizabeth Cady Stanton
          and does not mention the free-love debate of the 1870s or suffragist Annie Savery. (See Louise Noun’s <em><a
              href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/u?/suffrage,2524" target="_blank">Annie Savery and the Campaign for
              Women’s Rights in Iowa</a></em>.) Bloomer does, however, chronicle nineteenth century struggles of Iowa
          suffragists and conveys the hopeful mood of the mid-1880s. The full text of this work, including the Iowa
          chapter, is available on <a

        <p><strong>Bloomer, D.C., ed. <em>Life and Writings of Amelia Bloomer</em>. New York: Schocken Books,
            1975.</strong></p>
        <p>Dexter C. Bloomer gives a glowing account of his wife’s suffrage and temperance work, including
          descriptions of her work in Council Bluffs starting in 1855. Bloomer’s account illustrates how difficult
          suffrage and temperance work were in an Iowa frontier town.</p>

            F. Davis. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1981.</strong></p>

        <p>Bordin provides analysis of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) as an organization and a social
          movement. She devotes considerable space to suffrage activities of the WCTU, including a brief explanation
          of campaigns in Iowa in the early 1880s. The inter-organizational arguments over partisanship and the
          subsequent split with the Iowa WCTU delegation are also discussed. </p>
        <p>Bordin claims the WCTU provided women with an acceptable avenue to advocate for suffrage within existing
          religious and family structures. Bordin has also written a biography of Frances Willard, national president
          of the WCTU during the organization's early suffrage efforts.</p>


        <p><strong>Buhle, Mari Jo, and Paul Buhle, eds. <em>The Concise History of Woman Suffrage: Selections from
              History of Woman Suffrage edited by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Matilda Joslyn Gage and
              The National American Woman Suffrage Association</em>. Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press,
            2005.</strong></p>
        <p>The Buhles critically analyze the <em>History of Woman Suffrage</em> as a partisan and defensive view of
          the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), only one organization in the national struggle for
          suffrage. Pulling excerpts from Stanton, Anthony, and Gage’s original work, they contextualize certain
          events and provide a more nuanced view of the movement. Iowa is specifically mentioned in regards to
          Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s 1871 lecture tour, where she spoke out about birth control and the state’s support
          for the 1877 Colorado suffrage campaign. </p>

              of the Suffrage Movement</em>. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1923.</strong></p>
        <p>Written shortly after women won the vote, Catt and Schuler look back at the work of the National American
          Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). They provide insight into lessons learned from legislative failures in
          Iowa and how women’s suffrage crossed the “devious trail” of politics. Although written as a history, it is
          more a first-hand account of the struggles and triumphs Catt saw through her involvement with NAWSA.</p>

        <p><strong>Coon, Anne C., ed. <em>Hear Me Patiently: The Reform Speeches of Amelia Jenks Bloomer</em>.
            Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 1994.</strong></p>
        <p>Amelia Jenks Bloomer started as a temperance advocate but soon developed strong opinions about women’s
          rights through her work outside of the traditional “woman’s sphere.” She became a popular lecturer in the
          early to mid-1850s, speaking about social, moral, and legal themes. She believed that “for woman to vote. .
          .is to elevate her in the scale of humanity,” and stressed this throughout her speeches.</p>
        <p>Speeches in this book include “Equality in Rights and Privileges,” which argues for <em>human</em> rights
          (December 7, 1855 Council Bluffs Methodist church), “Alas! Poor Adam,” which responds to Biblical arguments
          against suffrage (June 1870, Des Moines Baptist church,) and “A Principle of All Free Governments,” in which
          Bloomer uses the title phrase “hear me patiently” to refute arguments against enfranchisement.</p>
        <p>The introduction includes commentary and photos of the famous “bloomer costume” and a reference to
          Bloomer’s feelings of resentment toward Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony after her contributions
          to the book <em>History of Woman Suffrage</em> were heavily edited.</p>

              America 1848-1869</em>. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1978.</strong></p>
        <p>DuBois analyzes the women's suffrage movement through the context of feminism and claims suffrage was not
          an isolated institutional reform, but a true social movement. Early Iowa struggles are mentioned several
          times.</p>

        <p><strong>Egge, Sara Anne. “The Grassroots Diffusion of the Woman Suffrage Movement in Iowa: the IESA, Rural
            Women, and the Right to Vote.” Ames, Iowa: Masters thesis, Iowa State University, 2009.</strong></p>
        <p>This thesis examines how rural women thought of, talked about, and organized around women’s suffrage. By
          looking at a segment of the population often ignored by suffrage histories, Egge uncovers some unique
          challenges faced by suffrage activists in farming communities, but also shows that rural Iowa women were
          aware of the suffrage debate. She includes a discussion of several automobile tours used to promote suffrage
          in Iowa in the early 1910s.</p>

        <p><strong>Evans, Sara M. <em>Born for Liberty: A History of Women in America</em>. New York: Simon &amp;
            Schuster, 1997.</strong></p>
        <p>Evans places the suffrage movement in historical context by providing a broad look at how social, political
          and economic factors affected women and women’s movements throughout American history. She also discusses
          how the national suffrage movement changed over time and how that may have influenced state organizations.
          The town that hosted a suffrage parade in 1908, which Evans calls Boomer, Iowa, refers to Boone, Iowa.</p>

        <p><strong>Flexner, Eleanor, and Fitzpatrick, Ellen. <em>Century of Struggle: The Woman’s Rights Movement in
              the United States</em>. Cambridge, Mass.: The Belknap Press of Harvard University, 1996.</strong></p>
        <p>Considered one of the seminal works on women’s suffrage in the United States, this book discusses social
          and political factors that influenced the suffrage movement. Iowa’s role in the national campaign strategy
          and Carrie Chapman Catt’s leadership are discussed in Chapters 21 and 22. Flexner and Fitzpatrick also
          examine the opposition of Midwest brewing companies and associations to suffrage and the impact this
          opposition had on state campaigns. </p>

        <p><strong>Gallaher, Ruth. <em>Legal and Political Status of Women in Iowa</em>. Iowa City, Iowa: State
            Historical Society of Iowa, 1918.</strong></p>
        <p>Gallaher traces suffrage trends in the United States from the colonial era through the early twentieth
          century before focusing on the history of suffrage in Iowa.</p>
        <p>Although published before a final suffrage victory, this book is thorough in its coverage of legislative
          efforts from 1843 through 1918, as well as the efforts of Iowa players Amelia Bloomer, Carrie Chapman Catt,
          and Helen M. Gougar, the first woman to address the House of Representatives in the new state capitol
          building in 1888. </p>
        <p>Gallaher mentions clubs such as the Northern Woman Suffrage Association in Dubuque and the Men’s League for
          Woman Suffrage. Gallaher also researched gubernatorial support or opposition during this time frame -
          including Governor Larrabee’s experimental support of school and municipal suffrage. When Gallaher wrote,
          property owning Iowa women had been granted the right to vote on municipal and school elections regarding
          levy and tax issues, as well as drainage district administrative concerns.</p>

        <p><strong>Giele, Janet Zollinger. <em>Two Paths to Women's Equality: Temperance, Suffrage and the Origins of
              Modern Feminism</em>. New York: Twayne Publishers, 1995.</strong></p>
        <p>Giele examines what she sees as two separate and distinct feminist movements: temperance and suffrage. She
          discusses the role of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and the leading suffragists through the
          lens of the 1970s women’s movement. Although Giele does not specifically look at Iowa, women with Iowa ties
          such as Amelia Bloomer and Carrie Chapman Catt are mentioned.</p>

        <p><strong>Horack, Frank E. <em>Equal Suffrage in Iowa</em>. Vol. II, in <em>Applied History</em>, ed.
            Benjamin F. Shambaugh. Iowa City, Iowa: State Historical Society of Iowa, 1914.</strong></p>
        <p>Horack presents arguments for and against suffrage in the years leading up to the 1916 referendum. Part of
          a larger examination of Iowa government and social legislation, this chapter provides insight into the
          rhetoric used by suffragists and anti-suffragists in Iowa at this time. This section also includes a
          <em>Minority Report on Suffrage</em> by Thomas B. Reed arguing for women’s right to vote. The full text of
          Horack’s essay is available on <a

            Anchor Books, Doubleday and Company, 1971.</strong></p>
        <p>Kraditor looks at the ideas behind the suffrage movement and debunks the myth that suffragists had an
          official ideology or even a unified vision. She examines subjects such as religion, politics, and social
          reform and explains how ideas within those spheres changed with time, as did the suffrage movement. She also
          devotes considerable space to the suffrage movement in the South and racism within various suffrage
          organizations.</p>
        <p> Mary Jane Coggeshall of Iowa is briefly mentioned, as is Carrie Chapman Catt. This work provides a good
          background on the arguments for and against suffrage and the context in which these were made.</p>

        <p><strong>Marshall, Susan E. <em>Splintered Sisterhood: Gender and Class in the Campaign Against Woman
              Suffrage</em>. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1997.</strong></p>
        <p>Marshall takes a look at motivations behind the anti-suffrage movement and concludes that many “antis” were
          women who wanted to protect the status quo. She mentions several powerful Iowans opposed to suffrage,
          including members of the Iowa Association of Men Opposed to Woman Suffrage, which was formed to defeat the
          1916 referendum. She also examines the role of immigrants and brewing interests in opposing suffrage in the
          Midwest.</p>

              1840-1940</em>. New York: H.W. Wilson Company, 1940.</strong></p>
        <p>Carrie Chapman Catt wrote the introduction and one of the chapters for this book. Written as
          totalitarianism and communism were spreading in Europe and Asia, it paints a rosy picture of American
          women’s fight for democracy. It is also very NAWSA-centric, similar to <em>History of Woman Suffrage</em>
          and <em>Woman Suffrage and Politics</em>. There are a few timelines of state milestones in the appendices.

              Women's Rights in Iowa</em>. Iowa City: Iowa Women's Archives, 2002.</strong></p>
        <p>Annie Savery was an active suffragist in the early days of Iowa’s suffrage movement, but she was
          blacklisted after supporting a woman’s right to hold opinions outside of the social mores of the day. Her
          part in Iowa history was edited out of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony’s <em>History of Woman
            Suffrage</em>. Noun reprints speeches and letters written by Savery and provides insight into internecine
          warfare of the Iowa suffragists. This book is available in its entirety in the <a

        <p>Noun authored the seminal works on women's suffrage in Iowa. This book is cited in many national accounts
          of the suffrage movement. It focuses on the nineteenth century struggles Iowa women faced in obtaining the
          right to vote. Rich in details, this book describes the major events and players of the Iowa suffrage
          movement. Noun was thorough in her research and her bibliography is a valuable resource which lists primary
          source materials across the country and local Iowa newspapers that covered suffrage. This book is available

            Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2009.</strong></p>
        <p>Schwalm investigates the ways in which the upper Midwest’s black and white residents became engaged in a
          process of redefining the meanings and implications of freedom and citizenship. Chapter 6 discusses how,
          even as the most economically disenfranchised of the Midwest’s black residents, African American women
          claimed the prerogative both to endorse an idealized black manhood and to challenge the extent of male
          privilege in their communities. Specifically, issues of personal and familial gendered viewpoints are
          touched on in relation to the law and practice of discrimination, as well as the resulting increased
          activism for some black mothers living in the Midwest.</p>

        <p>The Scotts provide a basic, brief introduction to the suffrage movement, drawing on the work of Ellen
          DuBois among others. Further, they include primary documents highlighting moments of the movement. One of
          these is Maud Wood Park’s recollection of the unveiling of Carrie Chapman Catt’s “winning plan” in which the
          National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) attacked the suffrage question from the federal and
          state levels. </p>

        <p>This overview of African-American history in Iowa includes a chapter on women by Kathryn M. Neal, that
          highlights African-American women “pioneers” who broke ground professionally or women considered to be
          “builders of their communities” by serving in clubs and organizations.</p>
        <p> The sections about the women of Buxton and Vivian Smith of the Waterloo Suffragette Council illuminate
          African-American women’s participation in the state’s suffrage movement.

          women lived and worked in Iowa and many of them were also active in the suffrage movement including: Mary
          Safford, Eleanor Gordon, and Mary Collson. TUcker describes the social reform and religious activities of
          these suffragists and how these women interacted with other Iowa suffragists and the national organizations.

        <b class="embolden">McCowen, Jennie. “Women in Iowa.” The Annals of Iowa 3 (1884).</b>
        <p>McCowen examines the legal and economic status of women in Iowa in the 1880s. McCowen applauds “the
          progressive and liberal attitude of the State toward women,” and lists occupations that women had attained.
          She briefly touches on the tenacity of the suffragists and their play on the state motto: “Our rights we
          prize, and our liberties we will secure.” [The actual motto is “Our liberties we prize and our rights we will
          maintain.”] This item is available in its entirety through the <a

          47, no. 7 (1985): 575-617.</b>
        <p>The first part of Noun’s biography of Amelia Bloomer covers her life before she moved to Council Bluffs in
          1855. Noun provides a good explanation of bloomers as a fashion trend and how they became associated with
          Amelia Bloomer. Bloomer did not invent the loose fitting costume but did help to popularize it. Noun explains
          that Bloomer was reluctantly won over to the suffrage movement after her efforts to enact temperance reform
          were blocked because of her gender. The State Historical Society of Iowa publishes The Annals of Iowa;

        <p>The second part of Noun’s biography focuses on Bloomer’s time in Iowa, particularly her early suffrage
          speeches and newspaper editorials. Noun gives readers a picture of what social activism and daily life were
          like in an Iowa pioneer town. This article also provides context for the fledgling suffrage movement in Iowa.

          130-144.</b>
        <p>Noun examines Catt’s early political experience in Cerro Gordo County schools and the beginnings of her
          suffrage work in Mason City. She argues that Catt and her husband left Mason City in the mid-1880s under a
          cloud of ill-will after their campaign efforts to get Catt elected to county office. Since then, Mason City
          history has been rewritten to portray Catt as a beloved hometown heroine. Noun also looks at Catt’s early
          political mistakes and assumptions. (Research notes and early drafts of this article are in <a href="">Louise

        <p>This look at Mrs. Mary E. Spencer’s term as Iowa’s legislative clerk in 1870 illuminates attitudes about
          gender roles held by members of the Iowa legislature in the nineteenth century. One of Spencer’s claims to

          of suffragists in 1871 and 1872 during the Victoria Woodhull free love scandal which was rocking the nation.

        <p>This statistical analysis of voting surveys and polls from the 1916 referendum shows strongest support for
          equal suffrage in dry counties, British-American counties, Protestant counties, and Republican counties in
          Iowa. Ryan also finds the size of the community or its rural location did not have a correlation in how men

        <p>This issue of Trail Tales focuses on women’s suffrage and provides a detailed account and discussion of the
          1908 Boone parade. Suzanne Caswell’s article analyzes the debate over whether or not Boone hosted the first
          suffrage parade in the U.S. The issue also includes a first-person account of the parade written by Rev.
          Eleanor E. Gordon and an edited transcript of the minutes from the 1908 Iowa Equal Suffrage Association
          Conference in Boone. Other articles examine the Unity Circle at the First Unitarian Church, the Women’s
          International League for Peace and Freedom, and why the struggle for suffrage is relevant to women today.</p>

        <p>This is a small collection of 38 photos selected according to the following guidelines: “...images that
          have been popularly requested in the past, to include images of people and events that are mentioned
          prominently in standard works on women’s suffrage, and to select images for which no copyright restrictions

          and, more generally, women’s rights are included, as are images depicting the public, often symbolic, way in
          which suffragists campaigned for the right to vote. The set also features cartoons commenting on the
          movement, as well as a photograph depicting the activities of anti-suffragists, illustrating the manner and

        <p>The site contains a slightly expanded and fully searchable version of the print publication <em>American

          The guide has been redesigned for online use, with added illustrations and links to existing digitized

          number of newly digitized items that provide a sample of the many relevant types of materials available in

        <p>Between 1897 and 1911 Elizabeth Smith Miller and her daughter, Anne Fitzhugh Miller, filled seven large

          part of the National American Woman Suffrage Association Collection in the Rare Book and Special Collections
          Division. These scrapbooks document the activities of the Geneva Political Equality Club, which the Millers
          founded in 1897, as well as efforts at the state, national, and international levels to win the vote for
          women. They offer a unique look at the political and social atmosphere of the time and chronicle the efforts
          of two women who were major participants in the suffrage movement. This collection includes digitized

        <p>The Schlesinger Library dates from August 26, 1943, when Radcliffe College received a collection of books,
          papers, and memorabilia on women reformers from alumna and suffragist Maud Wood Park. Her “Woman’s Rights
          Collection” became the nucleus of a research library called the Women’s Archives, which the college
          gradually augmented during the 1940s and 1950s. When the women’s movement surged in the 1960s and 1970s, the
          library’s collections grew rapidly as feminist activists recognized the importance of women’s history and
          created their own documents and publications. The collections listed below have a connection to the state of
          Iowa. Most of the documents themselves are not online, but links to the finding aids are included below.</p>

            <br> Mary Jane Whitely Coggeshall was born
            in 1836. Known as “the Mother of Woman Suffrage in Iowa,” Coggeshall was a founding member of the Polk
            County Iowa Woman Suffrage Society in 1870. She held numerous positions in the Iowa Equal Suffrage
            Association and served three terms as president. She was elected an auditor for the National American
            Woman Suffrage Association in 1902 and 1904, attended several NAWSA conventions, and was a speaker at
            those held in Washington, D.C. and Chicago. She also served as editor of <em>The Woman’s Standard</em> for
            its first two years of publication (1886-1888) and its last (1911). <p></p>
            <p>This collection, consisting almost entirely of her speeches and writings, is arranged in three
              sections: Iowa, NAWSA, and biographical sketches. The bulk of the collection is made up of Iowa
              material: speeches, responses by Iowa editors to the question of publishing suffrage articles, a history
              of the Polk County Woman Suffrage Society, a report on the 1904 state convention, and several letters to
              the editor, as well as clippings about the 1902 state convention, a suffrage poster, and memorabilia.
              The NAWSA section consists of speeches at and reports of national conventions. </p>
