            Even as they celebrated, the members of the Iowa Equal Suffrage Association (IESA)
            began planning for a new nonpartisan organization dedicated to political and
            civic education: the League of Women Voters of Iowa (LWV).

          <div>
            At the final convention of the IESA in
            <b class="embolden">1919</b> President Pauline Devitt spoke of
            the new role they would play, educating women voters and encouraging them to
            exercise their newly-won right: “We are here, women of this convention,
            to cast off the grave clothes and try our unaccustomed wings over new fields of action.”
          </div>
          <div>
            In the
            <b class="embolden">1920s</b>, the Iowa LWV sent state organizers to various communities
            to educate women about the political process and current issues.
          </div>
          <div>
            Local LWV organizations began to spring up across the state; more than
            100 women attended an organizing meeting in Osage, Iowa in
            <b class="embolden">1924</b>.
          </div>
          <div>
            Iowa women continued to be active on the national stage and to
            have close ties with women’s organizations elsewhere.
          </div>
          <div>
            In
            <b class="embolden">1923</b>, the National League of Women Voters held its convention in
            Des Moines, bringing national attention and business to the area.
