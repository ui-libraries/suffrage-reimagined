            In the long struggle for voting rights, Iowa’s efforts had been well-respected across the nation.
            Although women could vote as individuals, their organizing days were not over.
          </div>
          <div>
            In the fall of
            <b class="embolden">1919</b>, the suffragists met in Boone and formed the League of Women Voters of Iowa (LWV).
            That organization continues to educate voters today.
          </div>
          <div>
            To commemorate their struggle, veteran suffragists formed the Iowa Suffrage Memorial Commission in
            <b class="embolden">1922</b>.
            Fourteen years later, a bronze bas-relief was installed in the Iowa Capitol in Des Moines.

          <div>
            The right to vote did not bring about the sweeping freedoms for American women that some suffragists
            had expected. Women continued to fight for equality in the workplace, the political arena and the home.
            Much of that work continues today.
