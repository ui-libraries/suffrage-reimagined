        In 1926, legal provisions barring Iowa women from holding political office were lifted,
        and the Professional Women’s League of Des Moines (PWL) staged a burlesque of what
        they thought the Iowa state senate would look like in 1935.
      </div>
      <div>
        These women were optimistic that their newfound voting power would lead to a
        proliferation of high-powered women professionals and politicians.
      </div>
      <div>
        The records of the burlesque include mock telegrams from women too busy with business
        ventures to attend the Senate; mock Senate files - proposed, modified and vetoed by women;
        and a mock roll call of prominent suffragists turned politicians.
      </div>
      <div>
        These active women of the 1920s would be disappointed that, in 2011, only 22.6 percent
        of elected officials in Iowa were women even though women made up 53 percent of Iowa’s population.

            “The mission of 50-50 in 2020 is to achieve political equity for Iowa women by recruiting,
            training, and mentoring women in sufficient numbers that by the 100th anniversary of
            Woman Suffrage (the year 2020) Iowans will have elected females to fill 50% of the Iowa
            Legislature, the Iowa delegation of the U.S. Congress, and the office of the Governor.”
