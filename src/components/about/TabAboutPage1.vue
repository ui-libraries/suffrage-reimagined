            <p>Women gained the right to vote when the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified on
                <strong>August 26, 1920</strong>. But the struggle for the ballot began decades earlier.</p>
            <p>The story of Iowa women mirrors what happened on the national level. The Hawkeye state was often looked
                to as an example because of its ties to national suffrage leaders, a history of liberalism, and
                visionary organizing tactics.</p>
            <p>In honor of the 90th Anniversary of women&#8217;s suffrage, the Iowa Women&#8217;s Archives (IWA)
                received a grant from the State Historical Society, Inc. to digitize documents, photographs, and
                artifacts highlighting Iowa&#8217;s unique heritage.</p>
            <p>Materials from <a href="http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/iwa/" target="_blank" class="text-anchor">the Iowa Women's Archives</a>, <a
                    href="http://www.iowahistory.org/" target="_blank" class="text-anchor">the State Historical Society of Iowa</a>, and the

            <p>In addition, the Iowa Women's Archives has created this scrapbook exhibit to provide a brief introduction
                to Iowa&#8217;s suffrage history and point to local and state suffrage <router-link to="/resources"
