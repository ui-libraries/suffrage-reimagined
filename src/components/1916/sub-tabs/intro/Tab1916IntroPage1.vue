            From
            <b class="embolden">1916 to 1919</b>, Iowa was a suffrage battleground. On
            <b class="embolden">June 5, 1916</b>, Iowa’s men voted on a
            referendum to amend the constitution and grant women the ballot. Although the referendum failed
            in a corrupt election, the camapign piqued national interest. With the U.S.’s entry into World War I,
            Iowa women were sometimes torn between suffrage and war work, and suffrage campaigns
            faded a bit from the public eye.

            Just two years later, Congress passed the 19th Amendment, and the women of the Hawkeye state launched
            a ratification campaign. In a special session of the General Assembly held on
            <b class="embolden">July 2, 1919</b>, Iowa became
            the tenth state to ratify. On
            <b class="embolden">August 26, 1920</b>, Tennessee became the last state to ratify, finally ending
            the work Iowa women had been involved with for seven decades.
          </div>
          <div>
            In the year leading up to the
            <b class="embolden">1916</b> referendum, women created suffrage stamps and wrote suffrage songs,
            doing everything they could think of to win the vote. National leader Carrie Chapman Catt returned to
            Iowa to campaign. Pauline Devitt’s husband James even hired a nurse for this three-year time period so
            his wife could focus on the cause. Pauline Devitt became president of the
            Iowa Equal Suffrage Association (IESA) in
            <b class="embolden">1919</b>.
          </div>
          <div>
            Across the country, the tide was turning in favor of suffrage. In
            <b class="embolden">1916</b>, Alice Paul founded the militant
            National Woman’s Party, and Jeanette Rankin of Montana was the first woman elected to the U.S. House.
            In April
            <b class="embolden">1919</b>, just four months before the state ratified the 19th Amendment, the Iowa General Assembly
            passed a bill granting women the right to vote in presidential elections.
